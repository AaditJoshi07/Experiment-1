 ## **INTRODUCTION TO PHYTON**

**AIM:-**

To understand and implement basic Python programming concepts including printing output, variable assignment, data types, arithmetic operations, user input handling, mathematical functions, and conditional statements.

**THEORY:-**

Python is a beginner-friendly, high-level programming language widely used for automation, data analysis, and software development. The experiments cover:

* <ins>*Printing with separators:-*</ins>
Using print() with sep="\n" to format output across multiple lines.

* <ins>*Variable assignment:-*</ins>
Assigning multiple values to variables in one line using tuple unpacking.

* <ins>*Data types:-*</ins>
Understanding int, float, str, and bool using the type() function.

* <ins>*Arithmetic operations:-*</ins>
Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation using operators like +, -, *, /, and **.

* <ins>*User input:-*</ins>
Using input() and type casting (int() or float()) to accept values from users during runtime.

* <ins>*Importing Library:-*</ins>
Importing math to access constants like math.pi and functions like math.log10().

* <ins>*Conditional logic:-*</ins>
Using if-else statements to compare values and make decisions based on conditions.

**ALGORITHMS:-**

<ins>1. Arithmetic Operations:-</ins>

-->Prompt the user to enter two integer values using input() and convert them to int.

-->Perform arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

--> Display the results using print().


<ins>2. Area of Circle and Math Functions:-</ins>

-->Import the math module.

-->Ask the user to enter the radius of a circle (as int or float).

-->Calculate the area using the formula: area = math.pi * r * r.

-->Optionally, demonstrate other math functions like math.log10().

-->Display the result using print().


<ins>3. Conditional Statements (Greater Than Comparison):-</ins>

-->Assign values to two variables a and b.

-->Use an if statement to check if a > b.

-->If true, print that a is greater; otherwise, print that b is greater.
