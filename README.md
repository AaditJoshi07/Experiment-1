## **INTRODUCTION TO PHYTON**

## 🔹 1. Printing Items with `print()` and `sep="\n"`

### **Aim**
To understand how to display multiple items on separate lines using Python’s `print()` function with a custom separator.

### **Theory**
The `print()` function in Python can take multiple arguments and display them together. By using the `sep="\n"` parameter, we tell Python to separate each item with a newline, so each word appears on a new line.

### **Algorithm**
1. Use the `print()` function with multiple string arguments.
2. Set the `sep` parameter to `"\n"` to print each item on a new line.

### **Conclusion**
We successfully printed multiple items—Orange, Apple, Banana—each on a separate line using `sep="\n"`. This helps in formatting output neatly.

## 🔹 2. Variable Assignment and Access

### **Aim**
To learn how to assign multiple values to multiple variables in a single line and access them individually.

### **Theory**
Python allows tuple unpacking, where multiple variables can be assigned values simultaneously. This is useful for clean and readable code.

### **Algorithm**
1. Assign values using `x, y, z = "orange", "apple", "banana"`.
2. Print any variable to check its value.

### **Conclusion**
We assigned three fruits to three variables and printed one of them. This shows how Python handles multiple assignments efficiently.

## 🔹 3. Data Types and Arithmetic Operations

### **Aim**
To explore basic data types in Python and perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

### **Theory**
Python supports various data types such as `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`. It also allows arithmetic operations using standard operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `**`.

### **Algorithm**
1. Assign values to variables of different types.
2. Use `type()` to check each variable’s data type.
3. Perform arithmetic operations using two numeric variables.

### **Conclusion**
We identified data types and performed basic math operations. This forms the foundation for handling data and calculations in Python.

## 🔹 4. Arithmetic Operations with User Input

### **Aim**
To perform arithmetic operations on two numbers entered by the user.

### **Theory**
Python’s `input()` function allows users to enter values during runtime. These values can be converted to integers using `int()` and used in calculations.

### **Algorithm**
1. Take two integer inputs from the user.
2. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
3. Display the results using `print()`.

### **Conclusion**
We successfully took user input and performed all basic arithmetic operations. This demonstrates interactive programming in Python.

## 🔹 5. Area of Circle and Math Functions

### **Aim**
To calculate the area of a circle using the radius provided by the user and explore basic math functions.

### **Theory**
The area of a circle is given by the formula \( \pi r^2 \). Python’s `math` module provides access to constants like `math.pi` and functions like `math.log10()`.

### **Algorithm**
1. Import the `math` module.
2. Take radius input from the user (as `int` or `float`).
3. Calculate area using `math.pi * r * r`.
4. Optionally, use `math.log10()` to demonstrate logarithmic functions.

### **Conclusion**
We calculated the area of a circle using user input and used a math function. This shows how Python handles mathematical operations using built-in modules.

## 🔹 6. Conditional Statements (Greater Than Comparison)

### **Aim**
To understand how to use conditional statements to compare two values.

### **Theory**
Python uses `if-else` statements to make decisions. The `>` operator checks if one value is greater than another.

### **Algorithm**
1. Assign values to two variables.
2. Use `if` to compare them.
3. Print the result based on the condition.

### **Conclusion**
We compared two numbers and printed which one is greater. This introduces decision-making in Python programs.
